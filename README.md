Nasa SpaceAPP Challenge Hackathon

> Hi! üëã I started this project as part of the NASA Space Apps Hackathon. Initially, it was just a simple WordPress site, but working on it sparked my curiosity and passion for web development. What began as a small experiment has now grown into something much more meaningful to me.
As I iterated on the project, I dove deeper into web technologies ‚Äî learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to gain control over every detail. Over time, I explored frontend frameworks like React to build richer, more dynamic interfaces. Each version of this project reflects a step in my learning journey, from basic static pages to interactive components and responsive layouts.
This repository represents both the current state of the project and my progress as a developer. It‚Äôs still very much a work in progress ‚Äî there are bugs, design inconsistencies, and features I‚Äôm planning to add. I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or bug reports to help improve it.
Thank you for checking it out! üöÄ
